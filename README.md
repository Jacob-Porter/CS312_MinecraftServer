# CS312_MinecraftServer

## Background
This repo provides pre-made scripts for using Terraform to instantiate an AWS EC2 instance and auto-setup a Minecraft server. It starts with listing requirements for the tutorial, configuring your AWS CLI with your AWS credentials, and finally making minor changes to `minecraft-setup.sh` and `main.tf` so that your terraform deployment takes only 2 commands and your own Minecraft server can be born. 


## Requirements
1) [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) is installed.
2) [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) is installed.
3) Already have or are able to create an [SSH key pair](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen).

## Configure AWS CLI
*If you are using AWS Learner Lab environment, ignore this section.*
1) Identify your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key (if applicable, you may also need your [AWS session token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) as well) [help](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).
2) In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```
4) Enter information asked and set your preferred region (I'm using `us-west-2`) *for output format, you can either leave it blank or use* `json`.

## Minecraft Server File
*This repo provides a minecraft server file already â€” it will require minor manual changes to work*
1) Create and name your Minecraft Server `.sh` file (if using the provided file, find the "Download minecraft_server._version_.jar" link [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server), and paste that link next to `MINECRAFTSERVERURL=` in `minecraft-setup.sh`).
2) In order for the EC2 instance to grab the file, you must upload the script to S3. In your terminal (either the AWS Learner Lab terminal or AWS CLI after [signing in to your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html)), run:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp minecraft-setup.sh s3://<recognizable-name>/scripts/<minecraft-server-filename>.sh
   ```

## Deploy using Terraform
*This repo provides a* `main.tf` *already; however, you may need to make changes to it based on server hardware requirements and/or region preferences*
1) In your terminal, navigate to the location of `main.tf`
2) Ensure your key pair path is correctly listed throughout the file (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
3) Under `resource "null_resource" "run_minecraft_setup" {`, edit the line
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp s3://"cs312-minecraft-server"/scripts/<minecraft-server-filename>.sh /tmp/<minecraft-server-filename>.sh
   ```
   so that it looks like:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp s3://<your-s3-bucket-name>/scripts/<minecraft-server-filename>.sh /tmp/<minecraft-server-filename>.sh
   ```
5) Run the command:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
6) Then run:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
7) This should create and set up your EC2 instance with a VPC, subnet, security group, gateway, and Elastic IP; pull your Minecraft server file from your S3 bucket; and start your Minecraft server file automatically. *(It may take a couple of minutes for the Minecraft server file to finish setting up!)*
8) You should see output listing the EC2 instance's IP address. This can be used to connect via Minecraft or to scan using tools such as `nmap` at port 25565.
